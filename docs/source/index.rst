Machine Learning Review
===================================

This is meant as a review for someone familiar with ML but wants to brush up on the fundamentals.

This is **not** meant to be completely original work. This is a compilation of good explainations and points I have found over the years. I will do my best to cite sources, but I may have missed some. If that is the case and you notice, please feel free to flag it to me and I'll add the source.

This is **not** meant to be a crash course from no prior knowledge. It may assume some basic familiarity with very common topics in ML, math, and CS.
